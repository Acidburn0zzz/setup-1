**Basic alternative to Firefox matching Sierra Negra theme**  
Along with this I recommend have Sierra-light theme in your `.themes`, and then in `about:config` create a `string` named `widget.content.gtk-theme-override` with value `Sierra-light`.  
`CODE-*.css` Files are CSS codes only - optional. Just for copy those and paste & use on `userChrome.css`
